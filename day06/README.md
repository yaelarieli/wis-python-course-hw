The main file is HW6_main.py

It imports an Excel file named "wprcl.xlsx." This file contains data with the vertical velocity of Lagrangian particles inside a cloud.
Each row is a different particle, and the column is the different time.

The 'mean_of_row' does the mean for each row and writes it in the Excel file. 

In the 'test_mean_w.py', there is a test for the mean function that uses the adapt function 'mean_of_row_for_test' .
